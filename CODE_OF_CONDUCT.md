# Code of Conduct

We want contributors and maintainers to have an enjoyable, productive, and
respectful experience when interacting with this project. This Code of Conduct is
inspired by widely used community standards.

Expected behaviour
- Be respectful and constructive when giving and receiving feedback.
- Use inclusive language and assume best intentions.
- Report problematic behaviour to the maintainers rather than engaging in
  public conflict.

Unacceptable behaviour
- Harassment, insults, or hateful language of any kind.
- Personal attacks, threats, or discrimination.
- Posting private or sensitive information (doxing).

Enforcement
If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct,
please contact the maintainers: `buttje@users.noreply.github.com` (or open an
issue marked `private`/`moderation` if your platform supports it). The project
maintainers will review reports and take action, which may include warnings or
temporary/permanent removal from the project.
